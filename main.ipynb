    "Engineer exibited poor skill during the hands on training. It took him a very long time to complete the individual training which resulted in the mission timer running out during the team training section. Once the timer expired, the hands-on training trial was restarted and participants again completed the individual training. Engineer's second attempt still took over 5 minutes to complete individual training. The competency test was then started at 13m remaining on the timer, the engineer took a full 5 minutes to complete the competency test. Experiment team decided that engineer should be allowed to proceed to avoid rescheduling dispite the evident lack of minecraft skill.\n",
