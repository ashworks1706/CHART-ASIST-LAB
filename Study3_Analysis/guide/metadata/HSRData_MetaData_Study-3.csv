Issues affecting all (or many) files,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9/8/2022 -- *_Vers-7.* files are TrialMessages (90 files) and associated DockerLogs (30 files), QCTrialMessages (90 files), QCAgentTrialMessages (90 files). The TrialMessages concern only NoAdvisor and HumanAdvisor trials. The files were automatically ""replayed"" or regenerated to repair measurement errors and omissions by certain Analytic Components (measurement agents). The QCAgentTrialMessages are a new file type that reports predicate tests of agent performance as defined by agent developers. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6/27/2022 -- Performers should use with care data from teams whose records indicate ""Testbed restarted"" or ""Agent relaunched"". Among restarted trials, the trials that were halted have data files prefixed Terminated_. The restarted trial files are normally named and should have normal content. Relaunched agents may may be starting up with no knowledge of prior trials, survey items, or events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6/27/2022 -- For TM000220 - TM000232 inclusive, the filename term ASI-Human was replace with Human to be consistent with other human-advisor files and our planned filenaming convention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6/21/2022 -- For TM000201 - TM000219 inclusive, HSRData_TrialMessages_Trial-T000*Vers-6.metadata replace _Vers-5 with corrections to several survey items. Trial-Training files were not revised, and so their version numbers are unchanged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6/21/2022 -- For TM000220 - TM000235 inclusive, HSRData_TrialMessages_Trial-T000*Vers-2.metadata replace _Vers-1 with corrections to several survey items. Trial-Training files were not revised, and so their version numbers are unchanged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5/13/2022 -- Note: ASI were frozen on this date. They were trained on Vers-5 or earlier versions of the No-Advisor data (see below), and potentially on Study-2 data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5/4/2022 -- *_Vers-5.metadata files of No Advisor data replace the corresponding Vers-4 files with data cleaned by script to remove from Vers-4 message lines before the Export Message and Trial:Start, and cleans up survey duplicates. There are no new logs because Vers-5 was generated by a cleaning script, and not by replay. I have renamed Vers-4 DockerLogs to Vers-5, just for clarity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5/3/2022 -- *_Vers-4.metadata and *_DockerLogs*Vers-4.tar.gz files of No Advisor data replace the corresponding Vers-3 files with data generated using repaired and optimized UAZ speech analysis agents. This revision was made 5/2/22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4/19-20/2022 -- *_Vers-3.metadata files of No Advisor data replace Vers-1 with data that are ""repaired"" to correct testbed and AC anomalies. The corresponding Docker logs each contain data from one team (rather than several logs per team previously published).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*_Vers-2.metadata files of No Advisor data are not available. They were generated during replay and repair of Vers-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known issues in the testbed / task environment:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In at least one instance (Trial 608), a participant (Transporter) takes a victim to all three zones but no chime or points occur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In at least one instance (Trial 611), a participant (Transporter) picks up victim_id 18, but magically puts down victim_id 13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In at least one instance (Team 205), a participant has difficulty picking up a victim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In at least one instance in or before no-advisor trials, a critical victim would not wake up in the presence of all participants. This bug was fixed after no-advisor trials were completed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases prior to ASI-advisor trials, a json message reports that a destroyed marker is not of the type of that marker but is the type the player is holding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases, there is a discrepancy between messages in Dozzle logs and those in *TrialMessages*.metadata files (i.e., one includes messages that the other does not).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases, a message from MQTT may not be valid json (e.g., it may be an empty string).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Rutgers AC  published some “NaN” and “Infinity” Python values, which are technically malformed JSON. Strict json parsers may not have processed these well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases (e.g., Team 97 Trial 495, around 10:39), a victim (call it A) placed in the treatment area rewards points only to another victim (B), after which no points can be awarded to B. This is a function of the sequence in which a participant holding two victims picks up and places a victim on a particular block.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases, the agent/asr/final messages (and consequently agent/dialog messages) have participant_id set to things like GREEN_ASIST1 instead of the PID: P000104",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
